    <h2>About Me!</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm Shivanshu a dedicated software developer with a deep passion for <b>programming</b> and
        <b>technology</b>. My fascination with the digital world began early in life, nurtured by the beautiful and tranquil
        valleys of Dehradun. Growing up in this serene and picturesque environment, surrounded by lush greenery, fueled my
        curiosity and creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a <b>Bachelor of Technology</b> in Computer Science, and over the years, I've developed a strong enthusiasm
        for programming languages and mathematical theory. Using Linux on a daily basis, I enjoy customizing my setup to
        enhance productivity and tailor it to my needs. Currently, I work on <b>GenAI</b> products, focusing on developing
        innovative solutions in the realm of artificial intelligence.
