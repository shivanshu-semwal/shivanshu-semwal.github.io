<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
    Hello! I'm Shivanshu a dedicated software developer with a deep passion for <b>programming</b> and
    <b>technology</b>. My fascination with the digital world began early in life, nurtured by the beautiful and tranquil
    valleys of Dehradun. Growing up in this serene and picturesque environment, surrounded by lush greenery, fueled my
    curiosity and creativity.
    <br />
    I have a <b>Bachelor of Technology</b> in Computer Science, and over the years, I've developed a strong enthusiasm
    for programming languages and mathematical theory. Using Linux on a daily basis, I enjoy customizing my setup to
    enhance productivity and tailor it to my needs. Currently, I work on <b>GenAI</b> products, focusing on developing
    innovative solutions in the realm of artificial intelligence.
    <br />
    Outside of coding, I have a diverse range of interests. I'm an avid <b>chess</b> player, having competed at the
    national level during my school years and continued to pursue it at university. Chess has taught me strategic
    thinking and patience, qualities that I find invaluable in my professional life. I also enjoy playing snooker and
    running, activities that keep me physically active and mentally sharp. <b>Drawing</b> is another passion of mine,
    offering a creative outlet that complements my technical pursuits.
    <br />
    Growing up in Dehradun instilled in me a love for nature and outdoor activities. The serene environment not only
    nurtured my passion for drawing but also instilled a sense of peace and balance that I carry into my professional
    and personal life. I believe that technology should be both functional and elegant, and this philosophy guides my
    approach to software development. I strive to create solutions that are not only effective but also intuitive and
    user-friendly.
