Hi, I am a software developer with a passion for creating innovative and efficient solutions.
This site showcases projects I have worked on and some technical blogs.

Outside of coding, I have a diverse range of interests. I'm an avid *chess* player, having competed at the
national level during my school years and continued to pursue it at university. Chess has taught me strategic
thinking and patience, qualities that I find invaluable in my professional life. I also enjoy playing snooker and
running, activities that keep me physically active and mentally sharp. *Drawing* is another passion of mine,
offering a creative outlet that complements my technical pursuits.

Growing up in Dehradun instilled in me a love for nature and outdoor activities. The serene environment not only
nurtured my passion for drawing but also instilled a sense of peace and balance that I carry into my professional
and personal life. I believe that technology should be both functional and elegant, and this philosophy guides my
approach to software development. I strive to create solutions that are not only effective but also intuitive and
user-friendly.
